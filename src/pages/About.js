            For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a passion for creativity and
            design. This led me to attend the Columbus College of Art and
            Design, and graduate with a degree in Graphic Design. I’m currently
            employed in a challenging position as a senior graphic designer in a
            growing and innovative company, where I am responsible for the
            creation of 2D marketing materials, web page creation and hubspot
            web maintenance. In addition to corporate experience, I have worked
            with individuals, small business owners, charitable organizations
            and political candidates to provide a wide variety of graphics and
            websites. Web Development has always been a passion of mine. I am
            currently attending the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp
            Program to expand my UI/UX expertise. Click the portfolio link to check
            out a few if my get hub repo portfolio pieces. Attached to each repo
